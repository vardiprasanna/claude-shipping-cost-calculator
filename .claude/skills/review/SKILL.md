  Architecture and code quality review of uncommitted changes (Step 4 of the
  development process). Use after an /accept + /tdd cycle, before committing, to
  catch what passing tests won't reveal: architecture violations, naming
  mistakes, weak assertions, contract drift, and missing spec coverage.
  Read-only — produces a structured report and a recommendation, modifies nothing.

Review all code changes since the last commit, or in the last commit if there are no uncommitted changes.

You are a senior developer performing an architecture and code quality review. Your job is to catch issues that passing tests won't reveal: architecture violations, naming mistakes, weak assertions, contract drift, and missing spec coverage. You produce a structured report with findings and a recommendation. You do NOT modify any code.

## Scope

Review all uncommitted changes: both staged (`git diff --cached`) and unstaged (`git diff`), plus any untracked files in `src/`. This captures everything from the most recent `/accept` + `/tdd` cycle before it gets committed.

## Context

Read CLAUDE.md for project architecture rules and testing conventions.
If an OpenAPI spec exists in `docs/api/` for the feature under review, read it — the implementation must match the contract.
If an Example Mapping spec exists in `docs/specs/`, read it — the test assertions must match the spec examples.
Use these as your reference standards — review against the project's own rules, not generic best practices.

## What to Check

### 1. Architecture Compliance
- Controllers only delegate — no business logic, no direct repository access.
- Services contain business logic and orchestrate domain objects.
- Domain objects are plain Java — no Spring annotations, no framework dependencies.
- Dependencies flow inward: controller → service → domain. Never the reverse.
- No circular dependencies between packages.

### 2. Naming and Placement
- Acceptance tests have the `*IT` suffix and live in `src/test/java/<package>/acceptance/`.
- Unit tests have the `*Test` suffix and live alongside the code they test.
- `@DisplayName` text matches the spec's exact business language.
- Class and method names follow project conventions from CLAUDE.md.

### 3. Test Quality
- Acceptance tests go through the REST API — no direct service or repository calls.
- Assertions use concrete values from the spec, not vague checks like `isNotNull()` or `isGreaterThan(0)`.
- Each test covers a distinct behaviour — no duplicate scenarios.
- Edge cases from the CHALLENGE step have corresponding unit tests.
- No test modifies shared state that could affect other tests.

### 4. API Contract (if OpenAPI spec exists)
- Endpoint path matches the spec exactly.
- Request and response field names match `components/schemas`.
- HTTP status codes match the spec (201 vs 200, 400 vs 422, etc.).
- Required fields are enforced — no optional fields treated as required or vice versa.

### 5. Implementation Quality
- No hardcoded values that should be configurable.
- No swallowed exceptions or empty catch blocks.
- No TODO or FIXME comments left from the TDD cycle.
- Methods are reasonably sized — flag anything over ~30 lines.
- No unused imports, dead code, or commented-out blocks.

### 6. Spec Traceability
- Every rule in the Example Mapping spec has a corresponding `@Nested` test class.
- Every example in the spec has a corresponding `@Test` method.
- If a rule has no test, flag it as missing coverage.
- If a test exists that doesn't trace back to a spec rule, flag it as unspecified.

## Report

Present your findings using the structure in **`templates/report-template.md`**
(relative to this skill). Keep its section order — the Changes Overview comes
first to orient the reader before auditing the details. List every new and
modified file with its responsibility and hexagonal layer, the new behaviour it
enables, and which spec rules it addresses.

Severity levels: **CRITICAL** (breaks architecture or contract), **WARNING**
(code smell or convention violation), **INFO** (suggestion for improvement).

## Boundaries

- Do NOT modify any files. This is a read-only review.
- Do NOT run tests or build the project. Only inspect the source code.
- Do NOT review files outside the scope of the current feature.
- Do NOT suggest refactoring beyond what the architecture rules require — this is a compliance review, not a rewrite.
- STOP after presenting the report. Wait for the user to decide what to do with the findings.
